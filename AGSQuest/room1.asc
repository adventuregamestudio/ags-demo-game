//If you open the room editor for this room, you'll see that the room property "Show player character" is set to FALSE.
//This can be useful for menu rooms, close-ups of small room areas, or anywhere else the player character might be hidden.

//To create this function, go to room actions (lightning bolt icon) and find "Enters room before fade-in."
